-- Problem 4
-- Largest palindrome product

-- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest
-- palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 =
-- 91 Ã— 99.

-- Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

largestPalindrome = foldl1 (max) $ filter (isPalindrome) [x*y | x <- [101..999], y  <- [101..999]]
